        Espresso can be seen as The-M-Project's little friend. Basically you would call it a build tool, but it is more. Espresso
        is aware of both The-M-Project and your application. It provides tools for initializing an application and for creating certain
        components.

    <p class="text">
        One of the most important features of Espresso is the built-in server. It is Node-based and, once started, builds your application
        on-the-fly whenever you request a specific url with any browser inside your local network. This allows you to test an application
        on any relevant mobile device without having to deploy it to a remote server.
