        The action sheet dialog is mostly known from iOS, where it is used in a variety of applications.
        It presents a dialog that offers multiple options to the user.
        One of these options often is a destructive action, e.g. for removing something from a collection. This button
        is rendered red.
        Another option is a 'Cancel'-Option that is used to not make a choice, but cancel it. It's rendered black in
        default.
        In addition to these two buttons, a variable number of other buttons can be defined by passing in an array to
        the property
        <span class="code">otherButtonValues</span>.
        In difference to the other two dialogs, the action sheet does not show a message, it only shows a title and the
        choices
        represented by buttons. The action sheet's behaviour and look is defined by its properties.
    </p>

    <div class="note text">Note: It is also possible to pass a function as action instead of a string (this is possible
        throughout every callback passing). It is executed in the scope of the target.
