        Since JavaScript's date object doesn't provide lots of built-in functionality, we decided to create a
        wrapper for this, called <span class="code">M.Date</span>. This utility object is equipped with many
        convenient and easy to use methods you will need when ever you are dealing with dates.

        To begin understanding the concept behind the Data Binding, let's take a look at a simple example app.
        Imagine you've got two textfield on your screen. You click into the first one - the master, begin to type
        and want the second one - the slave - to display exactly the same text. The figure below shows how this
        could look like.

    </div>

    <p class="text">
        How does this work? How does the first textfield tell the second one that it's content changed? Do they
        communicate directly at all? If you take a look at the observer pattern UML diagram above, you will see that
        they don't. Instead there is a "central instance", an M.Observable, that knows that the second textfield observes
        a property that is again set by the first textfield. This "central instance" is realised as a property of the
        corresponding controller to our views. The following sequence diagram illustrates this process of changing the
        value inside the first textfield and delegating these changes right to the second textfield.
