<h1>The-M-Docs</h1>
<p class="text">
    This is the official documentation of The-M-Project.<br />
    It exists beside the official <a href="http://www.the-m-project.org/doc/jsdoc/index.html" target="_blank">JSDoc</a> documentation but will replace
    the wiki on GitHub.
    <br />
    <br />
    You're invited to actively participate in extending our documentation. You can do this by forking our
    <a href="https://github.com/panacodalabs/The-M-Docs" target="_blank">The-M-Docs repository</a> on GitHub and then, after you finished your work, sending pull requests to us.

    <br />
    <br />

    It's work in progress but grows from day to day. If you have any suggestions, send us some feedback via <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/_themproject">Twitter (@_themproject)</a>,
    iRC (#themproject on irc.freenode.net) or via our <a href="http://www.the-m-project.org/contactUs.php" target="_blank">contact formular</a>.
