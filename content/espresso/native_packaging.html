        This article is about the native packaging feature of Espresso. We could also call it a tutorial
        since it will cover all the necessary steps to get from your web app to a app store ready iOS/Android
        application. First we will talk about some requirements your system has to provide in order to
        use this feature. Then we'll cover the configuration part which is actually pretty intuitive but
        some explanation might help anyway. Afterwards we will take a look at the available Espresso commands
        for this feature and then finally end up in a working sample. Let's go!

    <p class="text">
        The Espresso package feature currently supports native build for iOS and Android. But since Espresso
        basically only offers a simple and convenient interface to the platform's tools, there need to be some
        things available on your system in order to use this feature. Espresso does not ship with an Android SDK,
        an iOS SDK or a iOS PhoneGap installation - but, depending on the targeted platform, they are required.

        So let's first talk about <strong>Android</strong>. What you will need to do is:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>
            Download the Android SDK:
            <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Follow the install and setup instructions: <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the SDK's <span class="code">tools/</span> and <span class="code">platform-tools/</span> directories
            to your <span class="code">PATH</span> environment variable: Look for "How to update your PATH" on the
            instructions page
        </li>
        <li>
            Setup at least on so called Android Virtual Device (AVD) with the desired API level:
            <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/devices/index.html</a>
            <br/>Later on you will have to tell Espresso that API level and it will automatically launch the application in the corresponding
            emulator.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text">
        And how about iOS? Here we go:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Make sure you are running on Mac OS X! Unfortunately there is no alternative when building for iOS.
        </li>
        <li>
            Download Xcode (including the iOS SDK):
            <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Follow the install and setup instructions: <a href="http://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/" target="_blank">http://developer.apple.com/support/xcode/</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Download PhoneGap: <a href="http://phonegap.com/download" target="_blank">http://phonegap.com/download</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Follow the install and setup instructions: <a href="http://phonegap.com/start#ios-x4" target="_blank">http://phonegap.com/start#ios-x4</a>
        </li>
    </ol>
