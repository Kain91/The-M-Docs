        This article is about the native packaging feature of Espresso. We could also call it a tutorial
        since it will cover all the necessary steps to get from your web app to a app store ready iOS/Android
        application. First we will talk about some requirements your system has to provide in order to
        use this feature. Then we'll cover the configuration part which is actually pretty intuitive but
        some explanation might help anyway. Afterwards we will take a look at the available Espresso commands
        for this feature and then finally end up in a working sample. Let's go!

        The Espresso package feature currently supports native build for iOS and Android. But since Espresso
        basically only offers a simple and convenient interface to the platform's tools, there need to be some
        things available on your system in order to use this feature. Espresso does not ship with an Android SDK,
        an iOS SDK or a iOS PhoneGap installation - but, depending on the targeted platform, they are required. What
        you will need to do is:
    </p>

    <p class="text" onclick="$('#setup_android').slideToggle();">
        <strong>Android</strong>
    </p>
    
    <ol style="display: none" id="setup_android">
        <li>
            Download the Android SDK:
            <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Follow the install and setup instructions: <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing.html</a>
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the SDK's <span class="code">tools/</span> and <span class="code">platform-tools/</span> directories
            to your <span class="code">PATH</span> environment variable: Look for "How to update your PATH" on the
            instructions page
        </li>
        <li>
            Setup at least on so called Android Virtual Device (AVD) with the desired API level:
            <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html" target="_blank">http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/devices/index.html</a>
            <br/>Later on you will have to tell Espresso that API level and it will automatically launch the application in the corresponding
            emulator.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text" onclick="$('#setup_ios').slideToggle();">

    <ol style="display: none" id="setup_ios">
        <li>
            Make sure you are running on Mac OS X! Unfortunately there is no alternative when building for iOS.

    <a name="config"><h2 class="line">The configuration</h2></a>

    <p class="text">
        Now your system is ready to use the native packaging feature. What else do we need? Sure, an app! For this article
        we will work with the Twitter app within our
        <a href="github.com/mwaylabs/The-M-Project-Sample-Apps" target="_blank">samples repository</a>.
        But feel free to work with your own app. It shouldn't be hard to adjust these following steps to your app.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        There's only one file you will have to work on to get the packaging up and running. One you might have worked on
        before for other reasons: your project's <strong>config.json</strong>
        <br/>
        With the native packaging feature the <strong>config.json</strong> accepts a new section called <span class="code">package</span>.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        To get started let's take a look at a working <span class="code">package</span> configuration for the mentioned Twitter sample. Since
        you might (and often will) have several configurations for different platforms, we have to name them. In this sample our configuration
        is called <span class="code">myIOSConfig</span>. This name will be used later on for the actual espresso package call.
    </p>
<pre class="syntax javascript">"package": {
    "myIOSConfig": {
        "method": "PhoneGap",
        "os": "iOS",
        "sdk": "iphonesimulator4.3",
        "package": "com.tmp.twitter",
        "activity": "Twitter",
        "mode": "debug",
        "plists": {
            "PhoneGap": {
                "ExternalHosts": ["*"]
            }
        }
    }
}</pre>

    <p class="text">
        Depending on the application and the targeted platform(s) this configuration might be more complex. But for not let's talk
        about the basic properties for <strong>iOS</strong>:
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>method</strong>
            <br/>This property specifies what packaging method to use. By now we only support PhoneGap. In the future there might come more.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>os</strong>
            <br/>This property specifies what the targeted operating system for this configuration is. Currently this has to be
            <span class="code">iOS</span> or <span class="code">Android</span>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>sdk</strong>
            <br/>This property specifies what target (simulator/device) and which SDK version to use. It should have the
            form <span class="code">iphonesimulator&lt;version&gt;</span> or <span class="code">iphoneos&lt;version&gt;</span> with &lt;version&gt;
            being greater or equal to 4.0. Make sure the specified SDK version is available on your system.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>package</strong>
            <br/>Provide a package name your the application in the form <span class="code">&lt;tld&gt;.&lt;yourdomain&gt;.&lt;yourapp&gt;</span>.
            The default value is <span class="code">com.test.mypackage</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>activity</strong>
            <br/>This specifies the name of the activity resp. the native application's name. The default is
            <span class="code">MyActivity</span>. Typically you would set this to the web app's name.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>mode</strong>
            <br/>This determines the build mode of the application. Currently there are two modes available:
            <span class="code">debug</span> (default) and <span class="code">release</span>. In debug mode, you won't have to provide any further information. If
            the release mode is activated, you will have to specify additional information for the code signing process. We will discuss this later.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>plists</strong>
            <br/>This property can be used to edit the native project's plist file. The provided JSON will automatically be transformed
            into a proper XML file for the native build process. One important section of the plist is the <span class="code">PhoneGap</span> section. As you
            can see in the sample configuration we set the <span class="code">ExternalHosts</span> to <span class="code">*</span> to be able to connect to
            any URL out there. Depending on your application their might be more properties needed within this section. If you are using some PhoneGap features
            like the accelerometer, you e.g. will have to add a <span class="code">Plugins</span> section to that property as follows:
<pre class="syntax javascript">"PhoneGap": {
    "ExternalHosts": ["*"],
    "Plugins": {
        "com.phonegap.accelerometer": "PGAccelerometer"
    }
}</pre>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text">
        With a valid <span class="code">package</span> section in the project's config.json, we are ready to let
        Espresso do some magic stuff. If you couldn't figure out so far what this new command is called, let's see
        if Espresso can tell us. Type the following in your terminal:
    </p>
<pre class="syntax shell">espresso help</pre>

    <p class="text">
        This will let Espresso print all the available commands.
    </p>

<pre class="syntax shell">Available commands:
build          Command to build a project
deploy         Command deploy projects
generate       Command to generate new or additional files for a project
init           Command line tool to generate a new project
package        Command to build native applications
server         Command to run the Development server
version        Command to print the Espresso version
help           Command to show help for a subcommand</pre>

    <p class="text">
        As you can see there is a command available called <span class="code">package</span>. This is what we were
        looking for. The usage of this command is as follows:
    </p>

<pre class="syntax shell">espresso package &lt;mode&gt; &lt;configName&gt;</pre>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>mode</strong>
            <br/>This determines whether to run the app in the simulator/emulator - <span class="code">run</span> -
            or to create an output file (*.apk/*.ipa) - <span class="code">build</span>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>configName</strong>
            <br/>This is needed to specify which configuration to use. It refers to the configuration's key within the JSON
            in config.json.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="text">
        So for launching our sample iOS configuration in debug mode (=simulator), we will have to run the following command:
    </p>

<pre class="syntax shell">espresso package run myIOSConfig</pre>

    <p class="text">
        If we did it all right, this should launch the iOS simulator and start an app called Twitter which is the original
        The-M-Project app inside of a native iOS container.

    <a name="style"><h2 class="line">What about styling?</h2></a>

    <p class="text">
        Did you notice that the app showed a default PhoneGap splashscreen on startup? And are you maybe unpleased with
        the app icon? Or is there even no app icon at all? Let's take a closer look at these things now.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        First of all: There's no need for more configurations! Styling (app icons/splashscreen) is based on resources,
        so Espresso handles this automatically and based on some conventions regarding the resources' file name. All you
        have to do is to place some PNG files with the right filename into your project's images directory (app/resources/images)
        and Espresso will do the rest. But what are these naming conventions?
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>App icon</strong>
            <br/>Basically it's: Name the file <span class="code">icon-SIZE.png</span>, with <span class="code">SIZE</span>
            being the pixel-size of the squared icon. What sizes are supported depends on the platform. For iOS it basically is:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>icon-57.png</strong>: iPhone without retina display (< iPhone 4)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>icon-72.png</strong>: iPad
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>icon-114.png</strong>: iPhone with retina display (> iPhone 4)
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Splash screen</strong>
            <br/>The naming convention for the splash screen is: Call it <span class="code">splash.png</span> resp.
            <span class="code">splash@2x.png</span>. The size of these images should be 320x480 resp. 640x960.
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p class="text">
        Now be creative and add some images to your project's image directory. If you're not in the mood, you can also
        download a set of sample icons <a href="http://www.github.com/panacodalabs/The-M-Docs/raw/gh-pages/sample_icons_packaging.zip">right here</a>.
        If you now run the application with the same command as before, you should see the added splash screen and the
        app icon. Now play around a little with the simulator and try to switch from iPhone to iPad to iPhone (Retina) and see
        what icons are presented.

    <a name="ios_signing"><h2 class="line">The iOS signing part</h2></a>

    <p class="text">
        For now we only ran the package process in debug mode, so no certificate or anything was required. But now we want to take
        a closer look at how to create App Store ready ipa files by using the release mode of the packaging process. Therefore
        we will need to make some adjustments to the configuration and add some parts for the signing stuff.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
       There are three configuration parameters available that need to be set in order to successfully build a release version of
        your application:
   </p>

   <ol>
       <li>
           <strong>sign</strong>
           <br/>This property is used to specify the iPhone Developer name as shown in the keychain management app within the
           corresponding certificate.
       </li>
       <li>
           <strong>embed</strong>
           <br/>This property is used for specifying the absolute path of the provisioning profile to use.
       </li>
       <li>
           <strong>keychain</strong>
           <br/>This property specifies the absolute path to the keychain to use. By default this is set to <span class="code">
           $HOME/Library/keychains/login.keychain</span>, which should be the correct path in most cases. So if you never stored
           your keychain anywhere apart from the default location on your system you probably won't have to specify this property
           at all.
       </li>
   </ol>

    <p class="text">
        Ok, with these new properties added to the configuration we're all set now? Now, we're not. We still need to make some
        changes on the "older" configuration parameters. We will have to change the <span class="code">mode</span> to
        <span class="code">release</span> and set the targeted sdk to e.g. <span class="code">iphoneos5.0</span>. So this is
        how the final release configuration might look like:
    </p>
<pre class="syntax javascript">"package": {
    "myIOSConfig": {
        "method": "PhoneGap",
        "os": "iOS",
        "sdk": "iphoneos5.0",
        "package": "com.tmp.twitter",
        "activity": "Twitter",
        "mode": "release",
        "plists": {
            "PhoneGap": {
                "ExternalHosts": ["*"]
            }
        },
        "sign": "Dominik Laubach",
        "embed": "/Users/dominik/Path/To/My/Profiles/Twitter.mobileprovision"
    }
}</pre>

    <p class="text">
        No let's run it and let Espresso build an App Store ready ipa file. Voilà!
    </p>

    <pre class="syntax shell">espresso package build myIOSConfig</pre>
