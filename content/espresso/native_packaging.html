        This article is about the native packaging feature of Espresso. We could also call it a tutorial
        since it will cover all the necessary steps to get from your web app to a app store ready iOS/Android
        application. First we will talk about some requirements your system has to provide in order to
        use this feature. Then we'll cover the configuration part which is actually pretty intuitive but
        some explanation might help anyway. Afterwards we will take a look at the available Espresso commands
        for this feature and then finally end up in a working sample. Let's go!
