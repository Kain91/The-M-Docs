        Since The-M-Project applications are page-based, switching pages is a pretty basic problem. With this tutorial
        we will take a look at how pages are connected and how you can switch from one page to another. We will discuss
        the meaning of a controller and the versatile options you have, when executing a page switch.

        Before you take a closer look at this tutorial, make sure that you are aware of the terms <span class="code">MVC</span>
        and <span class="code">Controller</span>. Additionally you should have a basic understanding of the architecture
        of an web app, built with The-M-Project.

        In order to be able to make page switches, we will need to setup an application that consists of more than on page.
        Therefore start Espresso and create a new, empty project:
<pre class="syntax bash">
    espresso init -p PageSwitchDemo
</pre>
    </p>
