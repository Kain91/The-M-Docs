        In order to address a maximum number of people, an application often needs to be available in several languages. So
        internationalization (i18n), is a key requirement for most mobile apps. Within The-M-Project, we provide something
        called M.I18N, that takes care of this job. It will help you to localize your application and to make it available
        in many different languages.

        To get an idea of what localization and internationalization may look like, check out our
        <a class="navlink" href="http://www.the-m-project.org/apps/todos">todos application</a> and play around with the
        language switcher.
