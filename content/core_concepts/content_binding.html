        Handling events and being able to respond to a user's actions is essential to any UI based application.
        As a developer you need to be able to make UI elements listen to events, more precisely to DOM events, in
        order to perform a certain action once the corresponding event was fired.
    </p>

    <p class="text">
        Within the The-M-Project framework, we provide a component called <span class="code">M.EventDispatcher</span>.
        This object is used to register DOM events for all UI components. This includes events that are typically
        fired by a certain user action, like tapping on a button (tap), and events that are fired by the framework itself,
        like indicating that a page will be shown now (pagewillshow). The available events depend on the particular view. A button,
        <span class="code">M.ButtonView</span>, provides the tap event, a page provides the pageshow event. A list of all events that
        are provided by a cerain view can be found within the documentation of the view itself.
